# Data Processing Project

This project is designed to read numerical data from an input file, perform calculations, and output the results to a designated output file. It consists of several Python scripts that handle different aspects of the data processing workflow.

## Project Structure

```

├── src
│   ├── main.py          # Entry point of the program
│   ├── processor.py     # Core logic for data processing
│   └── utils.py         # Utility functions
├── data
│   ├── input.txt        # Input file containing numerical data
│   └── output.txt       # Output file for results
├── requirements.txt      # Dependencies for the project
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Usage

1. Place your numerical data in the `data/input.txt` file. Each number should be on a new line.
2. Run the program using the command:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```
3. After execution, check the `data/output.txt` file for the results, which will include the total sum, average, and any errors encountered during processing.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` before running the program. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
